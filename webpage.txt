The article titled "What is HDR, anyway?" from Lux Camera discusses the concept of High Dynamic Range (HDR) photography, explaining its significance and common misconceptions. It outlines two primary meanings of HDR: the HDR mode introduced in iPhone cameras in 2010 and HDR displays that showcase more vibrant images. The piece explains the challenges of capturing scenes with varying light levels, emphasizing the term dynamic range, which refers to the contrast between the darkest and brightest parts of a scene.

The article also details solutions to the dynamic range issue, including the use of algorithms to merge multiple photographs with different exposures into a single image. Modern smartphones utilize advanced technology to automatically create HDR images, although these are actually Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) images intended to mimic human vision. This results in confusion around the true nature of HDR in photography.
