# MCP_Implementation

A Python implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for building AI agents.
This project is built from scratch, without relying on existing frameworks such as LangChain or LangGraph. The primary goal is to gain a deep understanding of the MCP algorithm and its underlying mechanics.

## Overview

This project implements the MCP (Model Context Protocol), a protocol designed to manage and exchange context information between AI models and agents. It is intended for experimentation, research, and educational purposes, enabling more effective context handling in AI-driven applications.

<!-- Add more details about the protocol, its goals, and its context here. -->

## Features

- Model Context Protocol implementation
- Modular agent design
- Easy-to-run test scripts
- Extensible for custom environments

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MCP_Implementation.git
    cd MCP_Implementation
    ```

2. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    <!-- If you don't have a requirements.txt, list dependencies here. -->

## Usage

To run the test agent:
```bash
python test_agent.py
```
